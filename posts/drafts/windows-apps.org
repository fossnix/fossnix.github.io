* Before anything..
For most programs you should use [[https://winehq.org][wine]], but for microsoft specific programs (i.g. Office 365) or programs that don't support wine there's only two ways:
+ dual boot
+ virtual machine
Both of these options are similiar in a way that you have to *boot* windows, rather than just opening a program.

So keep in mind that you will need some ram space and cpu power.

# todo, add a ss and narrow the ram/cpu usage down
In my case having windows virtual machine on the background, using /MicrosoftSQL/  (or any Office program) with the remote desktop protocol and the /brave/ browser with google meet open results around 4gb and at max one cpu at 100%.
* Setting up a windows virtual machine
On this example I will be using [[http://virtualbox.org][VirtualBox]], but you can use an already create
virtual machine on whatever software you use, if you know what you are doing.

/Note/: A password for the user is required.
** Steps
First thing is to install virtualbox. It is in almost all distro's repos.

/Note: some distros like voidlinux use the old/ ~virtualbox-ose~ /name./
*** Creating the VM
After opening the GUI,

Here you can use whatever name you want.

Just make sure its descriptive so that you dont confuse it with other VMs.

The Version should be *Windows 10 64Bit*

Most computers are 64bit and you dont want to be playing with 32bit emulation. Believe me.

The RAM should be adequate. Windows is a sihtty OS as we all know and consumes atleast 2gigs for itself.

If you are going to only be running Office 365 etc. it shouldn't matter.

Office365 recommends 2Gigs so i would suggest 3 gigs just to be safe.

We would be debloating windows in the next part of the article so RAM shouldn't be an issue.

Make sure you have atleast $\frac{1}{2}$ of your RAM for your host.

For Hard Disk File Type you can go with any of them. It doesn't matter.

This doesn't matter either but I recommend Dynamically Allocated as you can make the disk bigger if you run out of space.

I would suggest allocating 32 gigs of storage for the VM.

Microsoft suggests 20Gb for 64bit.

Office 365 needs 5gigs too.

Now is a good time to get your Windows ISO.

I like windows ame but if you arent comfortable with torrenting from telegram you can get the default iso too.

It doesn't matter.
** Configuring the VM
Now we need to go to Windows VM -> Settings -> Storage

Now click Choose a disk file and select the windows iso

Virtualbox uses NAT by default. This means the server wont be accessible outside of the host.

I usually prefer Bridged tho.

If you don't wanna give windows access to internet at all, use a host-only adapter.

/Note: We are running the vm in legacy bios. It is easier and a little faster. If you are using Windows 11, UEFI is necessary./

Now you can setup Windows like normal.

You don't neet to have a license key for windows.

Now we need to unmount the iso

Then if you restart the VM, You should boot right into windows.

Do the initial setup and shutdown the VM

/Note: The performance for now will be choppy. That is because we havent installed guest additions yet./

Add a new CD.

In the new menu that appears chose 'Leave Empty'.

Now start the VM.

In the VM Toolbar choose Devices -> Insert Guest Additions CD Image.

Now in Windows, click on the new CD drive in This PC and then run vboxguestadditions.exe as admin.

After that reboot.

Now you can run your debloater of choice.

I recommend [[https://christitus.com/debloat-windows-10-2020][Chris Titus Tech's one]].

Now you can install all your favourite windows only applications.
* Linux (host) setup
** Installing freerdp
You will need /xfreerdp/ package:


On Arch based systems
: # pacman -S freerdp

On Debian/Ubuntu based systems
: # apt get install freerdp2

Consult the documentation of your distribution..
** Connecting to the virtual machine
First, start up the virtual machine. I use the command below on virtualbox (or use the gui).
: /usr/lib/virtualbox/VBoxHeadless --comment VMNAME --startvm VMNUMBER --vrde config
I believe you can see the ~VMNUMBER~ on the info about the box. After this the virtual machine will run in the background.


After that we can finally use freerdp. For example to run excel 2016, I do:
: xfreerdp /v:IP /u:linus /p:passwd /app:"C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Excel 2016"
Now the ~/app~ path it's the non-constant variable. ~/v~ most of the time you want it fixed (non DHCP) and the ~/u~ user and ~/p~ password as well.
